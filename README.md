## üöÄ Getting Started - Launch Web3 Sentinel

Follow these steps to get Web3 Sentinel up and running:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
    cd YOUR_REPO
    ```
    _*Replace `YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO` with your actual repository details.*_

2.  **Set up Environment Variables:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the `.env.example` file provided.
    *   **Crucially, securely store your API keys and sensitive information as environment variables.**  **Do NOT hardcode them directly into the code.**
    *   Example `.env` file:

        ```env
        LLM_API_KEY=your_llm_api_key_here
        GITHUB_API_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
        DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
        REDIS_URL=redis://host:port/
        # ... other configurations ...
        ```

3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command will build the Docker images and start all the necessary services (agent core, web UI, database, etc.).

4.  **Access the Web UI:**

    Once the services are running, access the Web UI in your browser at:  `http://localhost:your_web_ui_port` (default port will be specified in your `docker-compose.yml` or configuration).

## üîí Security Considerations - Built with Security in Mind

Web3 Sentinel is designed with a strong focus on security:

*   **Secure API Key Management:** API keys and sensitive credentials should **never** be hardcoded. Utilize environment variables and secure vault solutions for production deployments.
*   **Input Sanitization:**  Implement robust input sanitization and validation throughout the agent to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Output Encoding:**  Ensure proper output encoding to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the web UI.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the codebase and dependencies to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Management:**  Keep dependencies up-to-date and monitor for security advisories.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Apply the principle of least privilege to service accounts and API access.
*   **Responsible Use:**  Use Web3 Sentinel ethically and responsibly.  Respect rate limits of APIs and scraping targets.  **Do not use for malicious purposes.**

**Disclaimer:** Web3 Sentinel is a powerful security tool, but it is not a silver bullet.  It should be used as part of a comprehensive security strategy.  The developers are not responsible for any misuse or damages resulting from the use of this tool.
